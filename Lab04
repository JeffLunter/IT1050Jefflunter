    //1. The four elements of counter-controlled repetition are the control variable, the initial value, the increment, and the loop-continuation condition.
    //2. For loops are for when you already know how many times you want to go through the loop and while loops are for when you don't know that number.
    //3. The difference between the two is the order in which the loop runs. You would want to use a do...while loop when you want the statement to at least loop one time.
